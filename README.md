# 3d-map-rl-localization
Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme(UROP) at Imperial College London on '3D Map-based Deep Reinforcement Learning Localization', supervised by Dr Aaron(Yiren) Zhao and Dr Ilia Shumailov. Authored by Anthony Bolton.


Work in progress... I am trying to transfer all my work to this repo that I did over summer 2023 working as a Research Intern at DeepWok Lab at Imperial. I also plan on picking it up again, refactor it and finishing my results over summer 2024.

# Overview
`3d-rl-map` is a state-of-the-art DRL model leveraging satellite imagery from Google Earth Engine API - aimed at estimating coordinates of event occurrences from image inputs shared across digital platforms. 

This is a currently a model working with data of 2D bird's-eye view sattelite imageries. The goal is to construct a baseline model of 3D views.
